### Front End Dynamics 🖌️
Using the power of Next.js 13.4 and React, the user interface strikes a balance between aesthetics and functionality, drawing inspiration from the sleek design principles that Spotify embodies. Powered by the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, the UI seamlessly adapts to diverse devices and screen sizes.

### Backend Foundation 🏢
